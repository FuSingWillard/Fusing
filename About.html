        <p> Fu Sing is a locally owned and operated Chinese restaurant that has been providing Chinese food to Willard and the surrounding area since 1991. At Fu Sing, we are committed to bringing together the freshest ingredients and whipping up some of the most sought for Chinese foods. There is no limit to what we make, becasuse we are happy to customize a dish for YOUR pallets. 
       
        <p>The coder for this webpage is Jackie Cheng. He is a senior at Willard City Schools, and with the help of his Mentor, Cody Williams, worked together in coding this project. The idea came from the lackluster amount of usage of technology. Many customers had issues with pricing and opening times. With the creation of this website, he is hoping that it will not only fix these problems, but at the same time bring in new customers to his family's small store.
